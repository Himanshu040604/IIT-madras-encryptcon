IIT Madras: Shaastra Ecryptcon 24hour hackathon
# Digital Identity Solutions for Secure and Sustainable Banking

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the Shaastra Ecryptcon 24-hour hackathon organized by IIT Madras. The challenge was to create a self-sovereign digital identity solution that empowers customers to have more control over their personal data and identity verification processes within the banking ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

**Digital Identity Solutions for Secure and Sustainable Banking**

## Track

**Digital Identity Assurance**

## Challenge

Develop a self-sovereign digital identity solution that empowers customers to have more control over their personal data and identity verification processes within the banking ecosystem.

## Features

1. **Multi-factor Authentication**: Users verify their identity using a combination of customer ID, passcode, password, and date of birth.
2. **Visual Password Setup**: During account setup, users select a personal image as their visual password. For subsequent logins, users must identify their chosen image from a lineup of 10 images. Correct identification grants access to the dashboard, while incorrect choices trigger a security alert and redirect to the login screen.
3. **Temporary Ban for Incorrect Credentials**: Mitigates security risks by imposing a 12-hour ban on user IDs after unsuccessful login attempts.
4. **Inactivity Timeout**: Automatically expires inactive sessions to safeguard sensitive information. (For this prototype, the timer is set to 15 seconds).

**Sample Credentials**

Customer ID: 9396144

Passcode: 1234

Password: password

Date of Birth: 10-12-2003
